+# MADLIBS
 
 +“Mad Libs” are short stories that have blanks called placeholders to be filled in. 
 + In the non-computerized version of this game, you ask someone to fill in each of the placeholders without telling them anything about the overall story. 
 + Once all placeholders are filled in, you show them the resulting silly story.
